# The rule of St. Benedict, as your Code of Conduct 
Inspired by the (old) news regarding [SQLite's Code of conduct](https://sqlite.org/codeofconduct.html) [[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18273530), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9qedai/sqlite_adopts_new_code_of_conduct/)], here is the Code of Conduct with the preface changed so you can adopt it for your projects if you wish to do so.

To know more about the reasons behind SQLite adopting the rule of St. Benedict, you can read SQLite's author Dwayne Richard Hipp [reply](http://sqlite.1065341.n5.nabble.com/Regarding-CoC-td104277.html#a104336) on SQLite's mailing list.
